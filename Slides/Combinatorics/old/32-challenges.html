    Coso: the challenges

    Combinatorics math word problems usually require few human-solvable steps.
    Covering all cases from the combinations of the statements of the formal language is far from trivial:
    <ol>
        <li class="fragment">
            Recognize and keep track of exchangeability on complex domains.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            Reason always at the most lifted level possible: propositionalization as the last resource.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            Splitting on multiple constraints.
        </li>
    </ol>
