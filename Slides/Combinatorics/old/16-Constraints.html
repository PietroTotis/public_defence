        Constraints specify desired properties of the configuration. A <em>constraint language</em> is a set of
        statements
        to compactly express valid assignments.

        Constraint modelling languages are very rich, but languages based on first-order logic typically have poor
        constraint support. This affects the opportunities for efficient reasoning.

        How constraints are expressed typically influences the reasoning efficiency of the solver, e.g. global
        constraints
        vs. binary constraints.
