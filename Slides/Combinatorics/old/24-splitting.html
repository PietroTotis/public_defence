    2. Splitting
</h2>

<div class="def">
    Splitting is the of dividing a problem $P$ into two independent subproblems $P_1$, $P_2$ such that the
    multiplication rule is applicable.
</div>
<div class="fragment example">
    A typical split of a problem $P$ is to consider a (random) variable $v$ and a value $c$ from its domain. <br>
    Let $P_1$ be $P$ plus the constraint $v=c$. <br>
    Let $P_2$ be $P$ with the constraint $v\neq c$:<br> $P_1$ and $P_2$
    are a
    split for $P$.
</div>
<!-- <div class="fragment def">
    Shattering is the repeated application of splitting (generalization to more than 2 subproblem)
