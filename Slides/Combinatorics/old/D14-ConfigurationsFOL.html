<h2>
    2. Configurations - First order logic
</h2>
<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
    Unordered configurations are problematic in FOL because predicates and constants are always labelled
    (distinguishble).
</div>
<div class="fragment example" style="font-size: 0.7em;">
    Sets (and multisets) configuration require additional constraints:
    $$ group(w_1)\land\dots\land group(w_5)\land w_1\\< w_2\land w_2\\< w_3\land\dots\land w_4\\< w_5 $$ Sets of sets
        cannot be encoded at all: <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
            Using predicates to represent the groups distinguishes them by the predicate name:
            $group_1/1,group_2/1,group_3/1$. <br>
            Assigning Alice to $group_1$ is different from
            $group_3$.

        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            Using constants to represent the groups distinguishes them by the constant name: $assign(Alice,G_1),
            assign(Bob,G_2),\dots$ <br>
            Assignments
            that
            only swap the name of
            the constant are the
            same partition in groups but they are counted as a different assignment</div>
</li>

</ul>
