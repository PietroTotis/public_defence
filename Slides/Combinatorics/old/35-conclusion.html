    <li class="fragment">
        A two-steps approach combines the state-of-the-art performances of neural networks on natural language
        understanding with the generalizability, explainability and modularity of declarative languages and solvers.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">The design of the formal language is fundamental to cover the domain of interest.</li>
    <li class="fragment">There is however a trade-off between the expressivity of the language and the
        complexity/efficiency of the
        solver. </li>
    <li class="fragment">Lifted reasoning can speed-up exponentially the solving times for problems with symmetries and
        aggregate operations.</li>
