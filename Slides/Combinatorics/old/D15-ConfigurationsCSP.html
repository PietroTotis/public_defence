<h3>
    2. Configurations - Constraint Modelling Languages
</h3>

<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">
    Support for configurations is better in constraint modelling languages but still does not cover all the table.

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">MiniZinc misses types for multisets and partitions</li>
        <li class="fragment">Zinc supports nested types like partitions, but not repeated objects, i.e. multisets</li>
        <li class="fragment">Essence has the multiset and partition types, but configurations of multisets are not
            possible
        </li>
    </ul>
